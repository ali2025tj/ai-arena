# ⚔️ The AI Arena: GPT vs Gemini

A fully automated, dynamic framework to pit Large Language Models (LLMs) against each other in logic and math battles. 

This system doesn't just compare speed; it uses an "LLM-as-a-Judge" (GPT-4 Turbo) to evaluate the **accuracy** and **quality of reasoning** of the combatants.
